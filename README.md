## Overview

  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first project after learning react. Learned how to use components to display and conditionally render the error message. Also learned one way to apply an animation in css so that it animates the toast in and out.

### Continued development

I want to build bigger react apps with multiple components and keep learning different hooks.
